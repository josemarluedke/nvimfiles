# vimfiles for Ruby/Rails development with [Ruby Dragon](https://github.com/joaomilho/ruby_dragon)

Support for Rails, Git, RVM, Sparkup, Haml, Slim, Sass, Less, CoffeeScript, Markdown Rdoc, and Jade with nice colour schemes.

## Requirements

**MacVim snapshot 73** & **VIM - Vi IMproved 7.4**

MacVim is required because it's easier to automate it using RubyDragon than just Vim.

Also both Vim and MacVim must have Ruby and Lua enabled. To install it with brew:

    brew install macvim --with-lua --with-ruby

Then make sure your mvim is properly linked (if you installed the package before you'll have to fix it).

**MacOS 10.8+**

Yes, Dragon Dictate is only for MacOS, so...

## Quick Install

```sh
curl -Lk bit.ly/1mBDHPv -o - | sh
```

[This is how it looks like.](http://showterm.io/35de6fa66b93acba2cd5a)

### [Nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) (`\p`)

Project file browser

`,p` opens file browser

`o` / `x` open and close files/folders

opening files.

### [Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) (`ys`/`cs`/`ds`)

Allows adding/removing/changing of surroundings

I would highly recommend getting to know this plugin, it is very useful.
Especially when you grok text objects.

*Characters*

`ysiw)`    - surround inner word with `()`

`ysiw(`    - surround inner word with `(  )`

In the above example `iw` can be replaced with any text object or motion.

If you find yourself manually adding surroundings, stop and work out the
correct text object or motion.

`cs"'`     - change surrounding from `"` to `'`

`ds`       - delete surrounding

*Tags*

`yss<p>`  - surround line in `<p>` tags

`cst<div>` - change surround tag to `<div>`

### [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized)

A colour scheme, both light and dark version

`:set background=dark`

`:set background=light`

### [Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) (`/l`)

Lists method names, provide auto complete

Run `ctags -R` or `,rt` in project root to generate tags

### [Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline)

Powerline is a utility plugin which allows you to create better-looking, more functional vim statuslines.

See instructions for install the fontpatcher [here](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/tree/develop/fontpatcher).


### [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)

Syntax checking

When a file is saved the syntax is automatically checked and any errors
reported.

### [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)

Plugin manager and part of the reason why my vimfiles as so compact

### [Rspec](https://github.com/josemarluedke/vim-rspec)

Run Rspec specs from Vim

`,t` run the full spec file

`,s` run the spec file under the cursor

`,l` rerun the previous spec command

This version of vim-rspec uses iTerm as default terminal. The original version uses the Terminal app.

### [Multiple cursors](http://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors)

True Sublime Text style multiple selections for Vim

## Installation

Note: If you are using RVM make sure you use system ruby before installation.

    rvm use system

Note: If you already have Vim installed ensure it has support for Ruby:

    vim --version | grep ruby

You should see `+ruby,` if you see `-ruby` you need to reinstall Vim with Ruby support

### Install Vim (if not already installed)

    brew install macvim --override-system-vim --enable-clipboard

Add `/usr/local/bin` before `/usr/bin` in your `$PATH` so you use the version of
vim installed by Homebrew, not the one that comes with MacOS.

By installing Vim in this way MacVim and regular Vim are exactly the same.


### Install these vimfiles

Note: If you have a `~/.vim` folder, either delete or move it.

    mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.old
    git clone https://github.com/joaomilho/vimfiles_ruby_dragon
    cd ~/.vim
    rake install

or run:

    curl https://raw.github.com/joaomilho/vimfiles_ruby_dragon/master/install.sh -o - | sh

#### To update to the latest vimfiles

    cd ~/.vim
    rake update

#### Install Dependacies

    brew install ack
    brew install ctags

Alternative to Ack

	brew install the_silver_searcher

More info [here](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).

Note: MacOS comes with the BSD version of ctags which is not compatible.
